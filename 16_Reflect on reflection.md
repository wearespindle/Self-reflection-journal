# Ready, set, reflect!

A reflection upon six weeks of self-reflection.

// Did you use the strengths that you wrote down in the beginning?

// How many nice days (happy smileys) did you have the past month? Are you satisfied with that?

// If not (enough), why is that? Is there a colleague that can help you with that? Or a coach? (make an appointment!)
