# Hi Colleagues!

Self-reflection is one of the most important skills you can train & develop. For yourself, as a person, but also as a professional skill. Maybe even more so in our self-organizing organization, where you are responsible for your own professional development.
Of course there are colleagues to help you with that, but it is up to you to decide how to use your strengths, which goals to work towards, and to identify areas where you could use a little help.

The last few years we have asked you to write a reflection document at the end of the year. This is a good starting point, but not enough to really develop self-reflection as a skill and a habit. To help with that, we have created this booklet as a little experiment. We deliberately choose for something small and analog, so you can choose how you use it and it is easy to keep private.

The ideas is to use this as a workbook for the experiment. The experiment is designed to last 42 days (hoping that it will provide you with answers to something, although perhaps not life, the universe, or everything) or 6 full weeks, which is enough to make most habits stick. There are no pages for the weekend. Each page contains daily prompts, or questions, which are intended as a guide, but feel free to fill up the pages with anything.

There are also 'bigger' questions at the start of the book, to help you set the things you want to focus on in the next six weeks, as well as questions at the end to reflect on those goals. And there are a few questions scattered in there that focus on the past or upcoming week.

What we hope you get from the experiment is a daily habit on reflecting on your day, identifying what worked and what didn't, some practice in breaking up your goals or ambitions into smaller parts and actively work towards them, more insights in what gives you energy and what doesn't, what makes a 'good day' for you at work so you can actively work towards having many more, and to perhaps identify some skills or traits that you would like to develop further with the help of a colleague, coach or instructor.

**Have fun!**

PS: Of course we'd love to receive your feedback as well - you can write your thoughts about improvements, things you hated and things you loved, or simply things that worked for you or didn't work for you on the last page, tear it out and give it to one of the Reflect Coaches.
