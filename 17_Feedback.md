Thanks for joining us in this experiment! We hope the habit of a daily reflection practice is starting to stick and you will continue. We are very curious to hear your honest answers about what you liked, what you didn't, what worked for you etc. Even if you did not complete the experiment, we would really like to know why!  
Fill in this page, rip it out an share it with one of the Reflect Coaches.
