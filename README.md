# Self-reflection journal

A journal that was originally published as a physical, printed product and shared with all Devhouse Spindle colleagues.
It's a journal-style book with weekly & daily prompts to reflect on the important things to work on, how to use your strengths to work on those things, and to reflect what makes you happy (or not) at work. The aim of the book is to support colleagues in developing a daily-self reflection habit.
